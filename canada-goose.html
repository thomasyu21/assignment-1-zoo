      The Canada goose is a large wild goose with a black head and neck, white cheeks, white under its chin, and a brown body. 
      It is native to the arctic and temperate regions of North America, and it is occasionally found during migration across the Atlantic in northern Europe. 
      Like most geese, the Canada goose is primarily herbivorous and normally migratory; often found on or close to fresh water, 
      the Canada goose is also common in brackish marshes, estuaries, and lagoons. Extremely adept at living in human-altered areas, 
      Canada geese have also established breeding colonies in urban and cultivated habitats, which provide food and few natural predators.
