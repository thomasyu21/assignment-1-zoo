    <p>
        Snowy owls are native to the Arctic regions of both North America and the Palearctic, breeding mostly on the tundra. 
        One of the largest species of owl, it is the only owl with mainly white plumage. 
        Males tend to be a purer white overall while females tend to have more extensive flecks of dark brown. 
        Juvenile male snowy owls have dark markings that may appear similar to females until maturity, at which point they typically turn whiter. 
        Most owls sleep during the day and hunt at night, but the snowy owl is often active during the day, especially in the summertime. 
        The snowy owl is a nomadic bird, rarely breeding at the same locations or with the same mates on an annual basis and often not breeding at all if prey is unavailable.
