    <p>
      Mourning doves are light gray and brown and generally muted in color. Males and females are similar in appearance. 
      They are one of the most abundant and widespread North American birds and a popular gamebird, 
      with more than 20 million birds (up to 70 million in some years) shot annually in the U.S., both for sport and meat. 
      Its ability to sustain its population under such pressure is due to its prolific breeding; 
      in warm areas, one pair may raise up to six broods of two young each in a single year. 
      The wings make an unusual whistling sound upon take-off and landing, a form of sonation. 
      The bird is a strong flier, capable of speeds up to 88 km/h (55 mph).
